            <h2>London</h2>
            <p class="info">
                London is the capital and largest city of both
                England and the United Kingdom, with a population of
                8,866,180 in 2022. The wider metropolitan area is
                the largest in Western Europe, with a population of
                14.9 million.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                As one of the world's major global cities,
                London exerts a strong influence on world art,
                entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education,
                healthcare, media, science, technology, tourism,
                transport, and communications. Despite a
                post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London
                Stock Exchange, London remains a European
                economic powerhouse, and one of the world's
                major financial centres.
            </p>

                London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.
                 The 2023 population of Greater London of just under

                population and over 16% of England's population.
                The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most
                populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants
                as of 2011. The London metropolitan area is
                the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14
                million inhabitants as of 2016, making London a
                megacity.
